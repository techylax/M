*******************************************************************
Connect LEDs with colours of your choice to GPIO05 for Listening and GPIO06 for Speaking Events.  

*******************************************************************
### **PUSHBUTTON TO STOP MUSIC/RADIO PLAYBACK AND MUTE MICROPHONE**  
*******************************************************************
Connect a pushbutton between GPIO23 and Ground. Single press mutes microphone and double press stops music streaming.  


************************************************
### **VOICE CONTROL OF GPIOs, SERVO and Pi SHUTDOWN**
************************************************
The default GPIO and shutdown trigger word is **trigger**. It should be used for controlling the GPIOs, servo and for safe shutdown of Pi.

It has been intentionally included to prevent control actions due to false positive commands.  If you wish to change the trigger word, you can replace the '**trigger**'in the main.py code with your desired trigger word.

The default keyword for servo motor is **servo**. For example, the command **trigger servo 90** will rotate the servo by 90 degrees.   

If you wish to change the keyword, you can replace the 'servo' in the action.py script with your desired keyword for the motor.

For safe shutdown of the pi, command is: **trigger shutdown**  

You can define your own custom actions in the **actions.py** script.  
**THE ACTIONS SCRIPT OF THIS PROJECT IS DIFFERENT FROM AIY KIT's SCRIPT, COPY PASTING THE COMMANDS FROM AIY's ACTION SCRIPT WILL NOT WORK HERE. FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE ACTIONS FILE, FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING YOUTUBE VIDEO.**

************************************************
### **VOICE CONTROL OF NodeMCU**
************************************************
There are two ways to control NodeMCU:  
1. Control of NodeMCU running a webserver.  
2. Control of NodeMCU running Sonoff-Tasmota Firmware.  

### **Controlling NodeMCU running webserver**   
Download the Arduino IDE code for Nodemcu from here: https://github.com/shivasiddharth/iotwemos/blob/master/Google-Home-NodeMCU.ino  

Add the wifi credentials, make the desired changes and upload the Arduino code onto the NodeMCU and get the IP address from the serial monitor.  

Add the NodeMCU's IP address in the **config.yaml**.  

**Syntax: "Hey Google, Trigger Turn _Devicename_ On/Off"**    

**FOR GUIDELINES ON MODIFYING THE ARDUINO CODE AND ACTIONS.PY FILE, FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING YOUTUBE VIDEO.**    

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=ae0iwJ62uaM
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/ae0iwJ62uaM/0.jpg"
alt="Detailed Youtube Video" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>

### **Controlling NodeMCU running Sonoff-Tasmota firmware**  
Download the Tasmota firmware from this [link](https://mega.nz/#!Dwx0lDYL!CK_QYoR9GvBhqdEmVs98ac45TjTjPIQyeaezYT4jfE0)

Follow the instructions in this video to upload the firmware properly.  

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=MzcAS-K_TRU
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/MzcAS-K_TRU/0.jpg"
alt="Detailed Youtube Video" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>  

Pi3 and Pi Zero users, assign the device names and device ip addresses in the **config.yaml** in the marked locations.  

**Syntax: "Hey Google, Turn _Devicename_ On/Off"**  

Advantage of using Sonoff-Tasmota over webserver is that, with Sonoff-Tasmota you can emulate a Wemo switch and control the NodeMCU using Amazon Alexa (Echo Devices) in addition to the GassistPi.    


************************************************
### **CASTING YouTube VIDEOS TO Chromecast**    
************************************************
Default command for casting YouTube videos is **Play *Desired Video* on Chromecast**, with **Chromecast** as the trigger word.

**Due to the Pi Zero's limitations, users are advised to not use the Music streaming feature. Music streaming will send the CPU usage of Pi Zero into the orbit.**  

************************************************
### **MUSIC STREAMING FROM Google Music**  
************************************************
The music streaming from Google Music uses [Gmusicapi](https://unofficial-google-music-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Enter your Google userid and password in the **config.yaml** file. If you are using a two-step authentication or two-factor authentication, generate and use an app specific password.

### Getting app specific password:
Refer to this page on google help - https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en

### What you can do:
Play all your songs in loop using the syntax: **"Hey Google, Play all the songs from Google Music"**

Play songs added to the user created playlist (does not include: most played playlist, thumsup playlist, etc) using the syntax: **"Hey Google, Play songs from the first playlist in Google Music"**
Playlists are sorted by date created, if you have multiple playlists, use a similar syntax replacing first with second, third etc. Also you need to make suitable changes in the main.py (It has been commented in the script to help)

Play songs by a particular artist using the syntax: **"Hey Google, Play songs by artist YOUR_ARTIST_NAME from Google Music"**

Play songs from particular album using the syntax: **"Hey Google, Play songs from album YOUR_ALBUM_NAME from Google Music"**

### What you cannot do at the moment: (some features may be added later):
Change tracks
Shuffle tracks
Repeat tracks

**Due to the Pi Zero's limitations, and computationally intensive nature of the Google Music streaming feature, this action has not been enabled for Pi Zero.**  


************************************************
### **RADIO STREAMING**  
************************************************
Default keyword for streaming radio is **radio**. For example, **play Radio 2** or **play Radio One** command will open the corresponding radio stream listed in the actions.py file.    

Radio streaming has been enabled for both OK-Google and Custom hotwords/wakewords.

Useful links for obtaining radio streaming links:   
http://www.radiosure.com/stations/  

http://www.live-radio.net/worldwide.shtml  

http://worldradiomap.com/map/  

**Due to the Pi Zero's limitations, users are advised to not use the Radio streaming feature. Radio streaming will send the CPU usage of Pi Zero into next galaxy.**  

***********************************************  
### **PARCEL TRACKING**  
***********************************************  
The default keyword for tracking parcel is **parcel**. For example, you can say **where is my parcel** or **track my parcel**.  

Regsiter for a free account with Aftership at https://www.aftership.com gnereate an API number and add parcels to the tracking list.
The generated API number should be added to the **actions.py** at the indicated location. For a better understanding follow the attached youtube video.

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=WOyYL46s-q0
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/WOyYL46s-q0/0.jpg"
alt="Detailed Youtube Video" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>

************************************************  
### **RSS FEEDS STREAMING**  
************************************************  
Default keywords for playing RSS feeds is **feed** or **news** or **quote**. Example usage, **top tech news** will play the top technology news, **top world news** will play top news related to different countires, **top sports news** will play the top sports related news and **quote of the day** will give some quotes.

Do not mix the commands with **Play** as that has been associated with music streaming from YouTube.  

**numfeeds** variable within the feed function in actions.py file is the feed limit. Certain RSS feeds can have upto 60 items and **numfeeds** variable limits the number of items to stream. The default value has been set to 10, which if you want can change.  


************************************************  
### **KODI INTEGRATION**  
************************************************  
### Enabling Kodi control    
In the config.yaml, under kodi, change control option from **'Disabled'** to **'Enabled'**.  

### Adding YouTube API and Generating API Key
The Kodi integration uses YouTube Data API v3  for getting video links. First step is to add the API to the project and create an API KEY.
1. Go to the projects page on your Google Cloud Console-> https://console.cloud.google.com/project  
2. Select your project from the list.  
3. On the left top corner, click on the hamburger icon or three horizontal stacked lines.  
4. Move your mouse pointer over "API and services" and choose "credentials".
5. Click on create credentials and select API Key and choose close. Make a note of the created API Key and enter it in the actions.py script at the indicated location.  
6. "From the API and services" option, select library and in the search bar type youtube, select "YouTube Data API v3" API and click on "ENABLE".
7. In the API window, click on "All API Credentials" and in the drop down, make sure to have a tick (check mark) against the API Key that you just generated.  

### Enabling HTTP Control on Kodi
The webserver is disabled by default and has to be manually enabled by the user.
1. This can be done in Settings → Services → Control → Allow remote control via HTTP.   
2. Set the port number to 8080, username to kodi and password to kodi  
(username and password should be in lowercase).

### Adding YouTube plugin on Kodi
For Kodi to play the YouTube video, you need to add and enable the YouTube Plugin on Kodi.  

### Command Sytanxes for Kodi Control  
**Note that "on Kodi" should be used in all the commands. If you want to use it exclusively, for Kodi Control, replace the given main.py and assistants.py file with the ones provieded in the extras/Kodi Intergration/ folder. In that, "on kodi" has been programatically added and other functions have been disabled,even genral queries like time and weather will not work. It is to be used only for the following Kodi commands.**
